# ML_Project 
(R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29))

Building of best regression model given training set, to predict pleasantness grades given by people exposed to a particular sent.

Our repertory contains five folders: 
- **Exploration**
- **linear models**: Lasso cross-validation
- **non-linear models**: Neuronal Networks and Boosting (also tree, randomForest)
- **Variance of models**: Comparison of the different best models after individual tunning in the previous files. 
- **Submissions**: code of the kaggle submissions 
- **Report**

The results are reproducible as seeds have been used throughout the code.
We implemented the code on Jupyter notebooks and the version of R is 3.6.3.

Before running the code, pay attention to the path for the download of the data.
